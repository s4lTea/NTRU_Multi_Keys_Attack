# NTRU_Multi_Keys_Attack
The initial NTRU problem was generally recognised to be intractable, followed by several variants such as the multi-key NTRU problem. Briefly, the problem refers to one generating multiple instances of NTRU public keys $\mathbf{h_i} = \mathbf{{f_i}}/\mathbf{{g}}$ from the same denominato $\mathbf{{g}}$ different $\mathbf{{f}}$, the task is to recover private keys $\mathbf{{g}}$(thus $\mathbf{{f_i}}$) through these public key instances $\mathbf{{h_i}}$. At DCC 2023, Kim et al. proposed the first polynomial time algorithm to solve this problem, which requires $N$ instances in ring $\mathbb{Z}[x]/{(x^{N}-1)}$. We point out the weaknesses of Kim's work, and propose a new polynomial time algorithm using linearization technique that requires half the number of instances, i.e., $\lceil{\frac{N}{2}}\rceil+1$. With specific parameters, the time required in the phase of solving equations is only tens of seconds, which indicates that our algorithm is efficient and practical
